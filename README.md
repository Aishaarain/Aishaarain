- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Aishaarain
- 
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in web development
- 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning front-end development
- 
- âš¡ Fun fact: So hereâ€™s the dilemma: I'm somewhere between a coding enthusiast and not entirely sure if I actually love coding ,
-  or if I just fell into this development thing because it sounded cool. Imagine a developer who writes one line of code and
-  then spends 30 minutes deciding on the next line, usually while daydreaming or grabbing a snack.Thatâ€™s me! I mean, I love the
-   idea of creating apps and building websitesâ€¦ as long as I donâ€™t have to get up too early
